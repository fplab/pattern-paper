\section{Implementation}
\subsection{Hazel}
We add constraints and inconsistent judgements to Hazel to support holes in case expression. Although Hazel enjoys richer types, such as bool and float, than Peanut, all of those can be easily generalized using methods discussed in this paper. Float can be treated exactly as num in this paper. Bool type can be viewed as one sum type. For this reason, we use InjL(Truth) and InjR(Truth) to bound True and False, respectively. After fixing syntax for the case expression, we emits the constraints and check for redundancy and exhaustiveness and generate errors accordingly.
